# Mapping-Environmental-Scenario-from-Sensor-Data
Recreating surrounding scenarios of a mobile robot or vehicle using data recorded by onboard sensors.

This Repo consists of files for the project 'Mapping Environmental Scenario from Sensor Data'.

### Included are:

Text files with GPS Data of Ego vehicle / mobile robot recorded from GPS sensor onboard in the form of latitude, longitude and timestamp.

Text files with Environmental Non-ego actors recorded by Lidar Sensors onboard in the form of Unique ID, position in XYZ coordinate and timestamp.

Above Non-ego actors are characterized in the Non-ego-properties textfile in terms of Class ID, Dimensions and Colour.

Video captured from onboard camera to serve as reference for validation only.

The road network data is by converting the map to OpenDrive network file and importing. Initialization done with the GPS data for origin.
